## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart |> 
  as_tibble()
```

> This dataset contains 1384617 rows, which represents the ordered
> items. And it contains 1384617 columns. Some key variables specifies
> the informations of each order, like `order_number`, `product_name`,
> `aisle`, `department`, and `order_dow`. They tells the time of the
> orders placed and some purchase activities for each product. In this
> dataset, there are 39123 products found in 131209 orders from 131209
> distinct users.

**Aisle number**

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

> There are 134 aisles, and the aisle has the most items is the fresh
> vegetables aisle.

**Make a plot (aisle has \>10000)**

``` r
aisle_plot = 
  instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n>10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes( x= reorder(aisle, n), y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Items",
    x = "Aisle number",
    y = "Number of item",
    caption = "Data from instacart online grocery shopping dataset 2017"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

> The plot shows the number of items in selected aisles in an ascending
> order. Only aisles that contains more than 10000 items were selected.

**Three most popular items table**

``` r
popular_items =
  instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(number_of_ordered_times = n()) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, -number_of_ordered_times) %>% 
  do(top_n(., 3, wt = number_of_ordered_times))

popular_items_table =
  knitr::kable(popular_items,
      col.names = c("Aisle", "Product name", "Number of ordered times"),
      title = "The 3 Most popular items in selected aisle")
```

> This table shows the three most popular item in `baking ingredients`,
> `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits` and lists the number
> of times each has been ordered.

**A 2 x 7 table**

As the `order_dow` tells the day of the week the order was placed on.

``` r
mean_hour =
  instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour) %>% 

knitr::kable(digits = 3,
             title = "Mean Hour Ordered of Selected Items")
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
mean_hour
```

| product_name     |      0 |      1 |      2 |      3 |      4 |      5 |      6 |
|:-----------------|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.774 | 14.316 | 15.381 | 15.318 | 15.217 | 12.263 | 13.833 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.441 | 11.360 | 11.702 | 14.250 | 11.552 | 12.784 | 11.938 |

> Above table shows the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
> and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. The variable
> `order_dow` tells the day of the week the order was placed on. The
> table has been `pivot_wider` to format for human readers. Pink lady
> apple were bought slightly earlier in the day 1, 2, 4, 6 each week
> than coffee ice cream. And both items were likely to be bought in the
> afternoon.
